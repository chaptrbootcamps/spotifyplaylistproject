# Spotify Automated Playlist
### Source the trendiest Kenyan songs and create an automated Spotify playlist 
In this project, your goal is to use the Spotify public API and get the songs most listened to in Kenya. You will then create an automated Python script to rank these songs based on your chosen metrics and add them to an automated Spotify playlist through the same Spotify APIs. You have autonomy over what genres to focus on whether you plan to change location focus to a different country or if want to boil down to a particular genre. The main goal is to create this ranking from available spotify data and add songs to your playlist remotely and automatically.

Refer to the [Spotify API documentation for info on how to access their data endpoints and how to navigate oath2 authentication](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/guides/)
